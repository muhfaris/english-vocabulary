    My day started with an exciting **brainstorming** session for a new feature. The team gathered in a meeting room with a large **whiteboard**, ready to map out ideas. We spent a good hour sketching out the user journey, which eventually turned into a detailed **flowchart**. It felt great to see our abstract thoughts take a visual shape.

    After the session, I was tasked with creating a simple **prototype** to showcase the core functionality. This first **iteration** wasn't meant to be perfect, but it needed to be clear enough to get early **feedback** from our main **stakeholder**. I quickly put together a **mockup** based on our discussion, focusing on the main user interactions.

    The goal is to present this to the product manager by the end of the day. It’s a quick turnaround, but having a tangible prototype makes it so much easier to align on expectations and avoid misunderstandings down the road. It’s days like these, filled with creative energy and collaboration, that I enjoy the most.
