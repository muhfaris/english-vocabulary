    I used to **procrastinate** on my weekly reports, but I've recently built a **streamlined** process that makes it much easier. This morning, I started by running a script that pulls all the necessary data. While it was running, I had a quick meeting with my project manager to discuss a new feature **enhancement**. She was very **receptive** to my ideas, which was great. I made sure to **jot down** the key takeaways from our conversation so I wouldn't forget them. By the time the meeting was over, my script had finished, and I just had to format the report. What used to take me hours now takes less than one. It feels great to have that extra time back in my day.
