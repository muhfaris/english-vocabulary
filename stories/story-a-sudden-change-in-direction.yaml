    My morning started with a fresh cup of coffee and the usual stand-up meeting. Everything seemed **on track**. My main task was to refactor a legacy module, and I was making good progress. But just as I **settled in**, a message **popped up** from my project manager. "Urgent: we need to pivot."

    Apparently, some feedback from our beta testers revealed a major **flaw** in our user flow. Management decided we needed to streamline the process immediately. This meant my refactoring task was no longer a priority. My manager asked me to **sketch out** a new design and present it by the end of the day. It was a sudden change, but I understood the **reasoning**. I quickly **acknowledged** the message and started sketching out some ideas. It was a classic case of needing to **adapt** to new information. I knew I had to touch base with the UI/UX designer to ensure my ideas were feasible. The day had just taken an unexpected **turn**.
