    During my first week, I had a pair programming session with a senior developer. She taught me about the team's coding conventions. "Our main **golden rule**," she said, "is to always leave the code cleaner than you found it."

    She showed me the official **style guide**, which covered things like naming conventions and formatting. But she also explained some of the team's **unwritten rule**s. For example, we always add a comment explaining the 'why' behind a complex piece of logic, not just the 'what'.

    She mentioned that while the company has several approved JavaScript frameworks, React has become the **de facto standard** for all new projects. Itâ€™s a **team norm** to have at least two people review any pull request before it gets merged. It was a lot to take in, but it was incredibly helpful for getting up to speed with how the team works.
