    The team gathered for a crucial meeting. The **go-live** for the new payments module was just a week away, and everyone could feel the pressure. "Alright team," said Maya, the project manager, "let's do a final **reality-check**. Are we truly ready?"

    Devi, the lead engineer, spoke first. "The code is solid, and QA has signed off. However, we need a clear **contingency** plan. What happens if we see a spike in errors after deployment?"

    The team spent the next hour mapping out potential issues. They decided to prepare a script for a quick **rollback**, just in case. They also put a temporary **stand-down** on any other non-essential deployments for 24 hours after the launch to minimize risks.

    "What about the **in-flight** transactions?" asked a junior developer. "What happens to payments that are being processed during the deployment?"

    Devi explained the graceful handling mechanism they had built. To ensure no stone was left unturned, they decided to **time-box** a final testing session to simulate this exact scenario. After the meeting, everyone felt more confident. They had a plan, a backup plan, and had addressed the key risks. The **debrief** after this meeting was positive, and the team was ready for the big day.
