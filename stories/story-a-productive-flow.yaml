    My day started with the morning **kick-off** for our new feature. The project manager walked us through the **agenda**, and we all agreed on the initial **scope**. After the meeting, I put on my headphones and went completely **heads-down**, getting into a state of deep **flow**. The code was just coming to me, and I made a ton of progress.

    Later in the afternoon, I hit a small snag with an API integration. Instead of struggling alone, I decided to **ping** my colleague, Sarah. We had a **quick sync** over video call, and she pointed out something I had missed in the documentation. It was a simple fix, but her fresh perspective saved me a lot of time. With that sorted, I was able to finish my task for the day, feeling accomplished.
