    My morning started as usual: a cup of coffee and reviewing my tasks. Just as I was getting into my work, a designer from another team, Sarah, pinged me. Her team was completely **swamped** and needed someone to **lend a hand** with a tricky CSS issue before their deadline. I felt a bit **overwhelmed** just thinking about adding more to my plate, but I knew how critical their project was.

    I told her I could help, but my own tasks were also piling up. I asked for the design **specs** to understand the requirements clearly. After reviewing the problem, I gave a **realistic** **estimate** of about two hours. It wasn't a complex fix, but it required careful testing to avoid any side effects. Helping them turned out to be a good decision. They were able to meet their deadline, and I learned a bit about their part of the product. It's moments like these that make the job feel collaborative and rewarding.
