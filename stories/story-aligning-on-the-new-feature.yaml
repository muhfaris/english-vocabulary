    The day kicked off with our usual **stand-up**. I had just finished a major bug fix, so my plate was clean. A new feature request had just come in, and my team lead asked me to take the **lead on** it. The initial requirements were a bit **vague**, so my first step was to schedule a meeting with the product manager.

    In the meeting, we worked together to **flesh out** the details. We created a few user stories and defined the acceptance criteria. It was a productive session that helped remove all the ambiguity. With a clear plan in hand, I felt much more confident.

    I spent the rest of the afternoon creating a technical **breakdown** of the tasks involved. I wanted to make sure I had a solid plan before writing any code. By the end of the day, I had a list of sub-tasks ready to be estimated. It felt good to start a new challenge with such clarity. It's important to **align** with the team before diving into the code.
