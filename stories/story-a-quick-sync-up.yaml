    I started my morning with a cup of coffee, getting ready for the daily **stand-up**. I had been working on a new feature, but I hit a **blocker** that I couldnâ€™t solve on my own. During the meeting, I mentioned my issue. My team lead, Sarah, suggested we **sync up** after the call.

    "I don't have much **bandwidth** today, but I can spare 15 minutes," she said.

    Later, she sent me a message: "Hey, can you give me a **heads-up** before you call?" I replied, and we started a video call. I shared my screen and started to **walk her through** the code. As I was explaining the problem, the solution suddenly became clear. It's funny how sometimes just talking about an issue can help you **figure it out**. The original **scope** of the task was smaller than I thought. We ended the call, and I got back to coding, feeling much more confident.
