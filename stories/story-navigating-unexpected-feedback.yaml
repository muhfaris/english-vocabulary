    On Friday morning, we had a demo of the new analytics dashboard. We thought it was nearly ready to **go-live**, but the feedback from stakeholders was more critical than we anticipated. They pointed out that the user experience felt a bit **clunky** and wasn't as intuitive as they had hoped.

    This feedback, although tough to hear, was a reality check. We had a quick team **huddle** to discuss the next steps. "Okay, let's not get discouraged," said Maria, our project manager. "We need to **regroup** and create a clear action plan. Let's **itemize** the feedback and prioritize what we can fix in the short term."

    We spent the rest of the day brainstorming solutions. It was a **humbling** experience, but it was also productive. We realized that we had been too focused on the technical implementation and had overlooked some key user needs. By the end of the day, we had a revised plan that everyone felt good about. It wasn't the end to the week we had expected, but it was a necessary **detour** to build a better product.
