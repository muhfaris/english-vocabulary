  text: 'My first task of the day was to refactor a module full of **spaghetti code**.
    The previous developer chose to **hard code** a lot of values, which made it very
    difficult to update. I had to store an API key as an **environment variable**
    to make it more secure and flexible.


    Later, I worked on a feature that involved a lot of user interactions. The **state
    management** was getting complex, and I had to be careful to avoid creating a
    **race condition** when saving the user''s data. It was a challenging but satisfying
    piece of work. I felt like I was finally untangling the mess and making the codebase
    healthier. It''s a slow process, but leaving the code better than you found it
    is always a good feeling.'
