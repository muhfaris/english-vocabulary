    As a new engineer, my first few weeks felt like a whirlwind. The **onboarding** process was thorough, but there was still so much to learn about the teamâ€™s specific ways of working. I quickly realized that understanding the unwritten **team norms** was just as important as reading the official documentation. My first task was to fix a small bug, and I made sure to follow the **style guide** closely to ensure my code was consistent with the existing codebase.

    When I submitted my first **pull request**, I was a bit nervous. But my tech lead, David, was amazing. He left clear and **constructive feedback** that helped me understand the bigger picture. It didn't feel like criticism, but rather a form of **mentorship**. He explained that the team values open communication and **knowledge sharing** to help everyone grow. This experience made me feel much more confident and part of the team. It was a great reminder that a positive team culture makes all the difference.
