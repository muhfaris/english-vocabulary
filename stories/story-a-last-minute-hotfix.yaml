    It was 4:45 PM on a Friday, and I was just about to close my laptop when a **critical** bug report came in. It was a **blocker** for our latest feature, and the **deadline** for the release was Monday. My teammate, David, and I decided to **jump on a call** to **align** on a plan. After a quick **code review** of the recent changes, we found the issue. It was a small mistake, but it had a big impact. We decided a **hotfix** was necessary. While David prepared the fix, I prepared the **deployment** script. An hour later, the fix was tested and ready to **merge**. Thanks to our quick **teamwork**, the **crisis** was averted. It was a reminder of how things can change so quickly in the world of software development. Our daily **stand-up** on Monday would be interesting.
