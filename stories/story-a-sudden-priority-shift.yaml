    It started as a typical Friday. I had my tasks lined up, a fresh cup of coffee on my desk, and a clear plan to wrap up the new feature before the weekend. But as we all know, plans in software development can sometimes **derail** quite spectacularly.

    Around 11 AM, an **unforeseen** issue was reported in our production environment. A critical part of the user dashboard was failing to load for a small subset of users. Immediately, it became a high-priority incident. My manager came over and told me to **drop everything** I was working on.

    The team had to **scramble** to figure out the root cause. We quickly assembled a small task force. My first job was to try and reproduce the bug in a controlled environment. It was a classic case of a context switch, forcing me to **reprioritize** my entire day. The calm, focused morning had turned into a race against the clock. Itâ€™s moments like these that test your ability to adapt and solve problems under pressure.
