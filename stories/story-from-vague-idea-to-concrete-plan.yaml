    The day started with a **high-level** meeting about a new feature. The product manager had a vision, but it was full of **ambiguity**. Our task was to turn that vision into a **concrete** plan. We scheduled a **brainstorm** session to flesh out the details.

    During the brainstorm, we debated different approaches and sketched out workflows on the whiteboard. It was a collaborative effort to translate the initial idea into clear **specifications**. We needed to make the plan **actionable** for the development team. We defined the scope, identified potential risks, and created a rough timeline.

    The most important part was getting **buy-in** from everyone. We presented our proposed plan to the product manager and the team lead. After a few adjustments, everyone was on board. The final step was to document the plan and create tickets in our project management tool. It felt good to see a vague idea transform into a clear **endgame**.
