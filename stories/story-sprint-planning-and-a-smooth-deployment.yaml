    The week started with a team-wide meeting to get **alignment** on the new quarter's goals. The main topic was the "User Dashboard V2" **epic**, a huge project the product manager had been planning for months. It felt like a massive undertaking, but breaking it down into smaller user stories for the upcoming **sprint** made it feel much more achievable. We spent the whole morning discussing priorities and estimating the effort for each story.

    My first task was to pick up a ticket for a new notification component. The designer had already prepared a detailed **mockup** in Figma, which made my job much easier because all the specs were clearly defined. I spent a couple of days coding the front-end and back-end parts. After a thorough code review from my senior, it was merged into the main branch.

    By Friday, we were ready to **deploy** all the completed work from the sprint. As per our process, we pushed everything to the **staging** environment first. The QA team ran their regression tests and gave us the green light an hour later. With everything looking stable, we initiated the final rollout to **production**. It was a smooth process, and we all felt a great sense of accomplishment watching the new features go live. Itâ€™s always satisfying to see your hard work in the hands of real users.
