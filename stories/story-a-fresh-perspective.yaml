    My morning was spent staring at a piece of code that just wouldn't work as expected. I felt completely **stuck**, unable to see a way forward. During our daily **stand-up**, I mentioned I had a **blocker**, but no one had an immediate solution.

    Around 2 PM, my teammate, Sarah, asked if I wanted to grab a **cup of coffee**. As we waited for our drinks, we started chatting about the issue. I drew a diagram on a napkin, explaining my approach. Sarah, with a fresh perspective, pointed out a logical flaw I had completely missed. She suggested we **brainstorm** a few alternatives.

    Her simple question sparked a new idea. We quickly sketched out a new **workflow** that seemed much more robust. It was amazing how stepping away from the screen and having a casual conversation could so easily **resolve** an issue that had been a major **hurdle** all morning. We went back to our desks, and with this new direction, I was finally able to move forward. It was a good reminder that sometimes the best solutions are found when you're not actively looking for them.
