    This week has been particularly intense. I've been feeling a bit swamped with the new project, and a little bit of **imposter syndrome** started to creep in. The codebase is complex, and I sometimes feel like I'm not learning fast enough. My manager noticed I was a bit stressed and reminded me about the importance of **work-life balance**. He told me to make sure I fully **unplug** after work and not to think about code during my personal time.

    During lunch, I decided to **take a breather** and walked around the park. It helped clear my head. When I got back to my desk, I decided to finally fix my chair and monitor height. Improving the **ergonomics** of my **desk setup** made a surprising difference to my comfort and focus. It's amazing how a few small changes can improve your entire day.
