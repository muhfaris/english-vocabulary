    I started my day ready to tackle a bug that had been in the backlog for weeks. It was related to our oldest and most complex **module**, and no one wanted to touch it. After a few hours of digging through the code, my **frustration** grew. The logic was **tangled**, and every change I made seemed to break something new.

    My manager noticed and suggested I take a short break. "A fresh **perspective** helps," she said. It was good advice. Away from my desk, I re-evaluated my **strategy**. Instead of trying to fix the bug directly, I realized I needed to refactor a small part of the module first.

    When I returned, I had a clear path forward. It wasn't just about fixing the bug anymore; it was about leaving the code in a better state than I found it.
