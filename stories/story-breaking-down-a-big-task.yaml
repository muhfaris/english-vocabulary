    Monday morning started with a new ticket assigned to me. At first glance, the scope seemed huge, and I felt a bit overwhelmed. The goal was to build a new notification system from scratch, and the initial description was quite vague.

    Before writing any code, I knew I needed to **collaborate** with the Product Manager, Sarah. We scheduled a quick call to walk through the requirements together. Sarah shared some great **insights** into the user problems we were trying to solve, which immediately made the purpose of the feature much clearer. She explained the core expected **behavior** of the notification system, helping me understand what was essential for the first release versus what could wait.

    This discussion was incredibly helpful. The task, which initially seemed daunting, now felt much more **manageable**. We agreed to break it down into smaller, logical pieces and prioritize the most critical parts for the current sprint. It was a huge **relief** to realize I didn't have to build the entire system all at once.

    Feeling much more confident, I grabbed my second cup of coffee and started mapping out the architecture for the first component. It's amazing how a 30-minute conversation can turn a mountain of work into a clear and achievable path forward. The rest of the day was productive, and I even had a preliminary design ready for review by the evening.
