  On Friday morning, our team had a quick **{briefing}** to plan the last push of the week. My main task was to **{solidify}** the design for the new authentication flow.

  I had an open pull request that needed some work. I had to **{make_revisions}** based on the comments from the senior developers. Their suggestions were insightful and definitely improved the code. After pushing the changes, I had to **{keep_tabs_on}** the CI/CD pipeline to ensure all checks passed.

  In the afternoon, I helped a colleague with a real **{enigma}** of a bug. We decided to **{join_forces}** and after an hour of debugging, we found the root cause. It was a great **{feeling_of_success}** to squash the bug before the weekend. The week ended with a **{successful_conclusion}** for our team's sprint goals.
