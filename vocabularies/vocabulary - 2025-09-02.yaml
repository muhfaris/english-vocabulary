    I was trying to use a new API, and the documentation said that to get all items, you should make a request to `/items`. I kept getting an error. After hours of debugging, I found a comment on a forum that revealed the gotcha: you had to include a specific header, `X-Client-Version`, or the API would reject the request. This wasn't mentioned anywhere in the official docs.
