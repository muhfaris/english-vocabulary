    During our sprint planning meeting, the project manager proposed a new feature. My team lead looked at our current tasks and said, 'That's a great idea, but we need to be realistic about our bandwidth. The team is already fully committed to finishing the payment gateway.

    I was stuck on a piece of code and couldn't figure out the correct API endpoint to use. I remembered my colleague, David, had worked on a similar feature. Instead of walking over to his desk and interrupting him, I just sent him a quick message on Slack: 'Hey David, quick question about the user service.'

  story: |
    I had just finished writing a complex piece of logic that calculated shipping costs. Before I wrote all the detailed unit tests, I wanted to do a quick 'sanity check'. I ran the function with a few simple inputs. 'If the cart is empty, is the shipping cost zero? Yes. If the destination is local, is the cost low? Yes. If the item is very heavy, is the cost high? Yes.' Since the results made sense at a high level, I was confident enough to proceed with writing the full test suite.
