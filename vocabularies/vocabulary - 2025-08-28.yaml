- word: "Bottleneck"
  pronunciation: "/ˈbɒt.əl.nek/"
  part_of_speech: "noun"

    english: "A point of congestion or blockage in a system that slows down the entire process. In software, it's often a piece of code or a service that can't handle the load."
    bahasa: "Titik kemacetan atau penyumbatan dalam sebuah sistem yang memperlambat keseluruhan proses. Dalam perangkat lunak, ini sering kali berupa bagian kode atau layanan yang tidak dapat menangani beban."

    - word: "Performance issue"
      difference: "A 'performance issue' is the general problem (e.g., the app is slow). A 'bottleneck' is the specific cause of that problem."
  story: |
    Our e-commerce site was running incredibly slow during peak hours. We did a performance analysis and found that while the web servers were fine, the payment processing service could only handle 10 requests per second. This was the clear bottleneck. All user requests were getting stuck waiting for this one slow service. Once we optimized the payment processing, the entire system became much faster.

- word: "Legacy code"
  pronunciation: "/ˈleɡ.ə.si koʊd/"
  part_of_speech: "phrase"
  meaning:
    english: "Old source code that is no longer supported or is difficult to maintain, but is still in use. It's often inherited from a previous team or version of a project."
    bahasa: "Kode sumber lama yang tidak lagi didukung atau sulit untuk dipelihara, tetapi masih digunakan. Seringkali diwarisi dari tim atau versi proyek sebelumnya."

  related:
    - word: "Technical debt"
      difference: "'Legacy code' is a common cause of 'technical debt' (the implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer). But you can also accumulate technical debt in new code."
    - word: "Boilerplate code"
      difference: "'Boilerplate' is repetitive code that is needed in many places with little to no alteration (e.g., setting up a new component). 'Legacy code' refers to the age and maintainability of code, not its repetitiveness."
  story: |
    I was assigned a bug fix in the user authentication system. When I opened the files, I realized I was dealing with legacy code. It was written 8 years ago by a developer who had long since left the company. There were no comments, no documentation, and the coding style was completely different from our current standards. Fixing a simple bug took me three days because I had to carefully navigate the fragile and complex legacy code.

      - "The setup process was confusing, I needed a walkthrough."
  related:
    - word: "Tutorial"
      difference: "A 'tutorial' is generally for teaching someone how to do something themselves. A 'walkthrough' is more like a demonstration where someone shows you how it's done."
    - word: "Code Review"
      difference: "A 'code review' is for analyzing and critiquing code to find issues. A 'code walkthrough' is typically for explaining the code to others so they understand how it works."
  story: |
    Our team just finished a major new feature. Before we presented it to the stakeholders, our product manager asked for a walkthrough. Our tech lead, Sarah, shared her screen and guided us through the entire user journey, from signing up to using the new feature. This walkthrough helped us all get on the same page and catch a few small issues before the big presentation.

    - word: "Refactor"
      difference: "'Refactoring' is a large-scale restructuring of code to improve its internal design. A 'tweak' is a small change, often to the external behavior or appearance (e.g., changing a color or a value)."
  story: |
    During user testing, we noticed that a button was not getting enough clicks. The feature worked perfectly, but the button's design didn't draw attention. Our UI designer suggested a small tweak. She changed the button's color from grey to bright blue and made the text bold. It was a tiny change that took only five minutes, but this simple tweak increased user engagement with the feature by 30%.

    - word: "Configuration"
      difference: "'Configuration' refers to settings that are external to the code. 'Hard-coding' is the practice of putting those settings inside the code."
  story: |
    A junior developer was working on a feature to display a list of products. In his code, he wrote: `const url = 'http://test.api.example.com/products';`. During code review, his senior pointed out that the API URL was hard-coded. "What happens when we move to production?" she asked. "We would have to find this line and change the code." She explained that the URL should be loaded from a configuration file, so they could use a different URL for testing and production without touching the code.

      - "He's worried about a million edge cases, but we should focus on the main problem first."
  related:
    - word: "Bug"
      difference: "An 'edge case' is a situation. A 'bug' is what happens when your code doesn't handle that situation correctly."
    - word: "Happy path"
      difference: "The 'happy path' is the default scenario with no errors or exceptions. 'Edge cases' are all the other scenarios that can happen outside the happy path."
  story: |
    We built a new feature that allows users to enter their birthday. The 'happy path' test, where a user enters a valid date, passed perfectly. But then, our QA tester started testing for edge cases. What if the user enters February 29th on a non-leap year? What if they enter a date in the future? What if they try to enter text instead of a date? We found several bugs because our code didn't handle these edge cases properly.

    - word: "Deep dive"
      difference: "A 'deep dive' is a comprehensive, in-depth investigation of a topic. To 'drill down' is often one of the actions you take *during* a deep dive."
  story: |
    Our weekly performance report showed that user engagement was down by 5%. This high-level number was concerning, but not very useful. During our team meeting, the product manager said, "Okay, we need to drill down into this data." We applied filters to the report, first looking at engagement by country, then by device type, and finally by user age group. By drilling down, we discovered the drop was almost entirely from users on older Android devices, which helped us pinpoint the problem.

  story: |
    We were interviewing a candidate for a senior developer position. He had a great resume and answered most questions well. But when we asked him about a time he had a disagreement with a teammate, he said he's never had one because he's always right. That was a major red flag for the entire interview panel. It suggested he might not be a collaborative team player, which is a critical skill for our team.

  story: |
    Our team was starting a huge, year-long project to rebuild our entire application. To keep morale high and show our managers that we were making progress, our team lead decided to identify a few quick wins. One of them was to add a 'dark mode' toggle to the current, old application. It only took one developer two days to implement, but users loved it. This quick win boosted the team's confidence and made everyone excited for the bigger changes to come.

  story: |
    On Friday afternoon, our senior engineer sent a message to the team channel: "Just a heads-up, I'll be merging the new database schema changes on Monday morning. This might cause some brief downtime for the test environment." This heads-up was incredibly helpful. It allowed all of us to finish our work in the test environment before Monday and saved us from the surprise of finding the system down when we started our week.
