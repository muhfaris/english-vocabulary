    During the final testing phase, the QA team found a **critical** issue. If a user tried to upload a file larger than 10MB, the entire application would crash. This was a showstopper for the release. The team had to work overnight to fix this **critical** bug, as the launch was scheduled for the next day. The fix was successfully deployed just a few hours before the official launch.
