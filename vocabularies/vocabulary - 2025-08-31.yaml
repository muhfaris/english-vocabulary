    Our team was debating whether to build a new feature from scratch or use a third-party library. There were strong opinions on both sides. Instead of forcing a decision, our tech lead facilitated a discussion about the pros and cons of each approach. After an hour of debate, we finally reached a consensus. We decided to use the library for now to save time, with an agreement to revisit the decision in six months.

By ironing out these small details early, they prevented a lot of confusion and bugs later on.
