  story: |
    The team was nervous about the major database migration. To de-risk the deployment, they opted for a canary release. They routed 1% of traffic to the new infrastructure and closely monitored performance and error rates. Everything looked stable, so they gradually increased the traffic to 10%, then 50%, and finally 100% over several hours.

  story: |
    All I wanted to do was fix a typo in the documentation. But to do that, I had to update the static site generator. To update that, I needed to install a new version of Node.js.

We need to meet all the acceptance criteria."
