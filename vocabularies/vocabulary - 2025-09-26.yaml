    During our sprint planning, a new ticket came in from the sales team. It described a customer issue as a 'critical system failure.' Our product manager, Dana, said, "Okay, team, let's take this at face value for now and prioritize the investigation. But, let's also have someone from QA try to reproduce it immediately. The last 'critical failure' was just a forgotten password."

- word: "A moving target"
  pronunciation: "/ə ˈmuːvɪŋ ˈtɑːrɡɪt/"

  meaning:
    english: "A goal or objective that is constantly changing, making it very difficult to achieve or plan for."
    bahasa: "Target atau tujuan yang terus berubah, sehingga sangat sulit untuk dicapai atau direncanakan."

    - word: "In flux"
      difference: "'In flux' means that something is in a state of continuous change. While a 'moving target' is a type of situation that is 'in flux,' 'in flux' can describe any unstable situation, not just a goal or objective."

  part_of_speech: "phrase"
  meaning:
    english: "Attractive but non-essential features or additions to a product or system."
    bahasa: "Fitur atau tambahan yang menarik tetapi tidak esensial pada suatu produk atau sistem."
  usage: "Use this to describe features that are 'nice-to-haves' rather than 'must-haves.' It's often used when discussing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to distinguish core functionality from extra, fancy features that can be added later."
  synonyms:
    - "Frills"
    - "Extras"
  examples:
    workplace:
      - "For the first release, let's focus on the core functionality and forget all the bells and whistles."

  related:

- word: "Punt on this"
  pronunciation: "/pʌnt ɒn ðɪs/"
  part_of_speech: "phrase"
  meaning:
    english: "To decide not to do or deal with something now; to postpone it."
    bahasa: "Memutuskan untuk tidak melakukan atau menangani sesuatu sekarang; menundanya."
  usage: "This is a casual, common phrase in meetings, especially in American English. You use it when the team decides a topic or task is not a priority right now or needs more information before a decision can be made. It's a slightly more informal way of saying 'postpone' or 'defer.'"
  synonyms:

      - "We were supposed to choose a restaurant, but we decided to punt on the decision and just order pizza."
  related:
    - word: "Table this"
      difference: "'Table this' and 'punt on this' are very similar. 'Table this' is slightly more formal and is common in official meetings, often implying the topic will be formally scheduled for a later discussion. 'Punt on this' is more colloquial and can feel more like avoiding the issue, though it's often used with the same meaning."
    - word: "Back-burner"
      difference: "To put something on the 'back-burner' is to deprioritize it. To 'punt on' something is to actively decide to postpone dealing with it at a specific moment.

    - word: "Prerequisite"

A new project manager, trying to be motivational, started talking excitedly about all the amazing features we were going to build next quarter. Our engineering manager quietly messaged him, "Hey, you might want to read the room. The team needs to talk about what went wrong, not jump to the next thing just yet."
