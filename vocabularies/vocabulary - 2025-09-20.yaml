    workplace:
      - "We just need a simple script to parse the CSV file; let's not over-engineer it with a microservices architecture."

    During a sprint planning meeting, the team discussed a new feature: a simple \"Forgot Password\" link. A junior developer, eager to impress, suggested a complex system involving multiple databases, a dedicated notification service, and AI-powered identity verification. The tech lead smiled gently and said, \"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think we might be about to over-engineer this. For now, a standard email reset link will do the job perfectly and won't take us three sprints to build.\"

- word: "deprecate"
  pronunciation: "/ˈdep.rə.keɪt/"
  part_of_speech: "verb"

    - word: "legacy"
      difference: "\"Legacy\" refers to an old system or code that is still in use, often because it's critical and hard to replace. \"Deprecate\" is the *action* of marking a part of that (or any) system for removal."
  story: |
    The team was working on a major library update. \"Okay everyone,\" Sarah, the team lead, announced, \"we've built a much more efficient function called `calculateNewMetrics()`. As of today, we will officially deprecate the old `calculateMetrics()` function. It still works for backward compatibility, but we'll add a warning in the console logs. Let's make sure all new code uses the new function, as we plan to remove the old one entirely by the end of the quarter.\"

    - word: "durability"
      difference: "\"Durability\" often refers to data, meaning the data will survive even if the system crashes (e.g., it's saved to disk). \"Resilience\" is broader and refers to the entire system's ability to keep functioning, not just the data's safety."
  story: |
    After a major cloud provider had an outage, half the internet seemed to go down. But the team's application stayed online. During the retro, the CTO praised them. \"This is why we invested so much time in building resilience,\" she said. \"Our multi-region setup with automatic failover worked exactly as designed.

    - word: "myth"
      difference: "A \"myth\" is a widely held but false belief or idea, often traditional or legendary. A \"fallacy\" is more specific to a flaw in the structure of an argument or reasoning process."
  story: |
    During a debate about system architecture, a new manager argued, \"We should build this as a monolith first. It's always faster.\" The senior engineer, Maria, gently interjected. \"That's a common fallacy,\" she explained. \"While a monolith can be simpler initially, for our specific use case with its independent, scalable components, starting with microservices will actually save us from major refactoring headaches down the road. The 'monolith-first' rule isn't a universal truth.\"

After some investigation, the performance team found the root cause. \"There's heavy resource contention on the primary database,\" the lead engineer reported. \"Too many threads are trying to write to the same table simultaneously, creating locks and long wait times.

  related:
    - word: "vague"
