    Our team was working on a major update to our web application. My task was to refactor the user authentication flow. This was a critical, user-facing feature, so I had to be extremely careful. Any bug could prevent users from logging in. I spent a lot of time writing tests and getting feedback from our designer to ensure the new login page was not only secure but also easy to use. Seeing the positive feedback from users after the release made all the hard work on this user-facing component worth it.
