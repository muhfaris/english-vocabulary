    bahasa: "Bernilai atau berarti kecil; (dalam software) tugas atau perubahan yang sangat sederhana untuk diimplementasikan."

  examples:
    workplace:
      - "The bug was just a typo in the config file, a trivial fix that took two minutes."

  examples:
    workplace:
      - "Can I get a quick gut check on this UI design? Does it feel right to you?"

After 30 minutes of comparing features, the engineering manager, Ken, said, "Okay, let's pause the technical debate. Tech Lead, give me a gut check. If we have a critical production issue at 3 AM, which one of these do you trust more to debug quickly?" The lead paused, then said, "The older one. My gut tells me the new one has too many unknown unknowns."
