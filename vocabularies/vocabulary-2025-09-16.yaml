After securing new funding, the CTO made a bold decision. "We can't keep patching this," he announced to the engineering team. "We're going to build version 2 from the ground up." It was a massive undertaking. They started with a blank canvas, choosing a new programming language, a modern architecture, and a scalable database. It took a year, but the result was a fast, stable, and flexible platform that was ready for the future. They didn't just fix the old house; they built a new one from the ground up.
