      difference: "'Transient' and 'ephemeral' are very close. 'Transient' often describes something that moves from place to place and doesn't stay long (like a transient population). 'Ephemeral' focuses more on the short lifespan of the thing itself."
  story: |
    A new developer was confused. "I can't find the server I deployed to yesterday," he said. "Ah," replied his teammate. "You used one of our dynamic test environments. Those are ephemeral. They automatically spin down after 24 hours to save costs. You'll have to deploy it again."
