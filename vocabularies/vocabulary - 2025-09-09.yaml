  story: |
    In the team meeting, the tech lead warned, "We have to be careful not to build this new platform piecemeal. If one team builds the UI, and another builds the API, and a third builds the database without a shared plan, we'll end up with a system that's a nightmare to integrate. We need a solid architectural plan first."

    A new developer asked, "Why is everyone so careful when they make changes to the 'CoreUtils' library?" A senior engineer replied, "Because that library is the mainstay of half our applications. It handles all our core logic for logging, configuration, and error handling. If you introduce a bug there, you could bring down multiple services. It's old, but it's stable and reliable."
